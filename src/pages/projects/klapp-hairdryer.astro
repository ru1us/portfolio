            Design a hairdryer that departs from conventional consumer-product
            aesthetics by embodying a clear, reduced formal language. The goal
            was to create an everyday object that not only performs
            functionally, but also stands confidently within diverse living
            environments — from private bathrooms to contemporary public spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge extended beyond technical requirements: the project
            explored how a strong, architectural design identity can translate
            into a product that remains approachable, balanced, and visually
            coherent.

            KLAPP is defined by its precise, angular geometry and a restrained,
            almost architectural clarity. The design appeals to users who view
            everyday objects as part of their interior landscape and appreciate
            products with a deliberate and honest form language.

            The silhouette is bold yet understated, built around sharp linear
            contours softened by subtle transitions. Carefully calibrated
            proportions ensure that, despite its firm geometry, KLAPP never
            feels bulky or rigid. The visual balance between edges and softened
            surfaces gives the product presence without dominance.

            A key design feature is the air intake: a large, graphically
            structured grid that blends seamlessly into the overall form. This
            element serves both as a functional opening and a defining aesthetic
            signature, adding rhythm and order to the product's appearance.

            The name KLAPP reflects its compact, distilled character — a form
            concentrated to its essentials. Avoiding decorative elements, the
            design communicates a clear message: functional, reduced, and
            quietly self-assured.
          </p>
          <p>
            KLAPP expresses stability and composure, while avoiding heaviness or
            lifelessness. It is more than a tool; it is an intentional design
            statement that elevates a familiar household device into an object
            worthy of attention.

            The hairdryer was modeled and rendered in 3D to explore proportions,
            surfaces, and material transitions with precision. High-quality
            visualizations helped refine the graphic character of the air intake
            and evaluate how light interacts with the sharply defined geometry.

            A distinctive hairdryer characterized by clarity, precision, and a
            strong formal identity. KLAPP demonstrates how reduction and
            structure can create emotional resonance in a functional everyday
            product.

            The project showcases an ability to translate conceptual values —
            order, simplicity, confidence — into a coherent industrial design
            language, resulting in a product that is both purposeful and
            visually memorable.
