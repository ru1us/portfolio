          <p><strong>Luce & Legno</strong> — Light and Wood. The Italian-inspired collection unites the tranquility of Apulian landscapes with the depth of the Mediterranean. Two material groups tell a story: "Olivo" features warm olive wood pieces with organic forms reminiscent of old trees and southern sun, while "Mare" translates the movement of the sea into modern forms using deep blue ribbed glass.</p>

          <p><strong>RAWLINE</strong> — Raw. Honest. Precise. An uncompromising statement for authentic, functional living shaped by industrial directness. Black alloyed steel with visible welds, round constructions reminiscent of industrial pipe systems, and grid elements create a cohesive ensemble. The collection includes "STRUKT" (bar stool), "FERRO" (faucet), and "LUXCORE" (lamp).</p>

          <p><strong>DIS/COMFORT</strong> — Rough. Direct. Unvarnished. This collection plays with expectations by citing familiar forms from public everyday life: surveillance camera, park bench, school locker, trash bin, manhole cover. Instead of distance and functionality, these objects offer warmth, softness, and domesticity. Comfort emerges where you don't expect it.</p>

          <p>Each collection was meticulously rendered in 3D and presented through an interactive website optimized for desktop viewing, allowing users to explore the pieces in detail.</p>

          <p>Three complete furniture collections with distinct identities — from Mediterranean warmth to industrial precision to conceptual provocation.</p>
          <p>A fully functional interactive website that serves as a digital showroom, demonstrating the versatility and unique characteristics of each collection while maintaining their individual narratives.</p>
          <p>The project successfully demonstrates the ability to develop multiple design languages simultaneously, each with authentic material choices, coherent formal vocabularies, and clear conceptual foundations.</p>
