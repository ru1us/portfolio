            Develop three distinct furniture collections, each with its own
            unique design philosophy and perspective, while creating a cohesive
            digital experience to showcase their individuality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the furniture design itself, a key component of the project
            was building an interactive website that bridges traditional
            furniture design with modern web technology — creating a digital
            showroom that makes each collection's story and character
            accessible.

            <strong>Luce & Legno</strong> — Light and Wood. The Italian-inspired
            collection unites the tranquility of Apulian landscapes with the depth
            of the Mediterranean. Two material groups tell a story: "Olivo" features
            warm olive wood pieces with organic forms reminiscent of old trees and
            southern sun, while "Mare" translates the movement of the sea into modern
            forms using deep blue ribbed glass.

          <p>
            <strong>RAWLINE</strong> — Raw. Honest. Precise. An uncompromising statement
            for authentic, functional living shaped by industrial directness. Black
            alloyed steel with visible welds, round constructions reminiscent of
            industrial pipe systems, and grid elements create a cohesive ensemble.
            The collection includes "STRUKT" (bar stool), "FERRO" (faucet), and "LUXCORE"
            (lamp).

          />
          <p>
            <strong>DIS/COMFORT</strong> — Rough. Direct. Unvarnished. This collection
            plays with expectations by citing familiar forms from public everyday
            life: surveillance camera, park bench, school locker, trash bin, manhole
            cover. Instead of distance and functionality, these objects offer warmth,
            softness, and domesticity. Comfort emerges where you don't expect it.

            An essential part of the project was developing a custom website to
            present all three collections in an engaging, interactive format.
            The website serves as a digital showroom, allowing visitors to
            explore each collection's unique aesthetic and philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built with modern web technologies, the site features smooth
            navigation, high-quality 3D renders, and a clean, minimalist design
            that lets the furniture pieces take center stage. Each collection
            has its own dedicated section with detailed information and multiple
            viewing angles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website is optimized for desktop viewing to provide the best
            experience when exploring the detailed 3D visualizations and design
            concepts.

            Each piece was meticulously modeled and rendered in 3D using
            Blender, creating photorealistic visualizations that showcase
            materials, textures, and lighting in detail. The renders serve both
            as marketing material and as a way to explore design concepts before
            physical production.

            Three complete furniture collections with distinct identities — from

            A fully functional interactive website that serves as a digital

            The project successfully demonstrates the ability to develop
            multiple design languages simultaneously, each with authentic
            material choices, coherent formal vocabularies, and clear conceptual
            foundations.
