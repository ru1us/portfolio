          <p>The goal of the project was to develop a digital product that helps users better understand processed foods — a category that shapes the everyday diet of young adults yet remains widely misunderstood. While processed products offer convenience, their ingredients, nutritional value, and long-term health effects are often unclear or misleading due to marketing strategies and complex labeling.</p>
          <p>The challenge was twofold: Uncover the real needs, motivations, and struggles users face when trying to make healthier decisions in a fast-paced lifestyle, and design an intuitive, motivating, and trustworthy digital platform that makes nutritional transparency accessible — without overwhelming users with complexity.</p>

          <p>The project started with extensive research to gain a holistic understanding of the problem, the market, and the target audience.</p>
          <p>Through surveys, user diaries, competitive analyses, personas, and contextual research, several patterns emerged: Convenience dominates food choices — especially among young adults balancing study, work, and irregular schedules. Users lack nutritional literacy: ingredient lists, additives, and processing levels are difficult to understand.</p>

          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> People struggle to recognize how processed their food really is and what health implications it may carry. They lack accessible, trustworthy guidance and easy alternatives that fit into busy routines.</p>
          <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Empower people to make informed decisions by offering a platform that explains ingredients clearly, highlights health impacts, and suggests practical, healthier alternatives — fast, intuitive, and motivating.</p>

          <p>With the strategic foundation set, we developed a wide range of solutions through card sorting, information architecture, design patterns, and heuristic evaluation.</p>
          <p>Core Features: Ingredient & processing analysis (incl. NOVA classification), Product comparisons with clear nutritional breakdowns, Simple, fast recipe alternatives to common convenience foods, Knowledge hub with concise facts and deeper articles, Interactive quiz for playful learning and user engagement.</p>

          <p>We created a high-fidelity interactive prototype that reflects the full user journey. Instead of using typical "healthy green" aesthetics, the visual language takes inspiration from fast-food color palettes, creating a familiar, approachable contrast.</p>

          <p>To evaluate usability and comprehension, we conducted testing sessions including: Thinking Aloud tests, UEQ (User Experience Questionnaire), ISONORM (DIN 9241-110) evaluation, A/B tests on navigation, layout, and content density.</p>
          <p>Users understood the overall structure quickly and rated the system as clear, understandable, and enjoyable to use. The quiz and mascot contributed strongly to motivation and positive emotional experience.</p>
