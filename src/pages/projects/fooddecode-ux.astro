            The goal of the project was to develop a digital product that helps
            users better understand processed foods — a category that shapes the
            everyday diet of young adults yet remains widely misunderstood.
            While processed products offer convenience, their ingredients,
            nutritional value, and long-term health effects are often unclear or
            misleading due to marketing strategies and complex labeling.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge was twofold: Uncover the real needs, motivations, and
            struggles users face when trying to make healthier decisions in a
            fast-paced lifestyle, and design an intuitive, motivating, and
            trustworthy digital platform that makes nutritional transparency
            accessible — without overwhelming users with complexity.

            The project started with extensive research to gain a holistic
            understanding of the problem, the market, and the target audience.

            Through surveys, user diaries, competitive analyses, personas, and
            contextual research, several patterns emerged: Convenience dominates
            food choices — especially among young adults balancing study, work,
            and irregular schedules. Users lack nutritional literacy: ingredient
            lists, additives, and processing levels are difficult to understand.

            <strong>Problem:</strong> People struggle to recognize how processed
            their food really is and what health implications it may carry. They
            lack accessible, trustworthy guidance and easy alternatives that fit
            into busy routines.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Vision:</strong> Empower people to make informed decisions by
            offering a platform that explains ingredients clearly, highlights health
            impacts, and suggests practical, healthier alternatives — fast, intuitive,
            and motivating.

            With the strategic foundation set, we developed a wide range of
            solutions through card sorting, information architecture, design

            We created a high-fidelity interactive prototype that reflects the
            full user journey. Instead of using typical "healthy green"
            aesthetics, the visual language takes inspiration from fast-food
            color palettes, creating a familiar, approachable contrast.

            To evaluate usability and comprehension, we conducted testing
            sessions including: Thinking Aloud tests, UEQ (User Experience
            Questionnaire), ISONORM (DIN 9241-110) evaluation, A/B tests on
            navigation, layout, and content density.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users understood the overall structure quickly and rated the system
            as clear, understandable, and enjoyable to use. The quiz and mascot
            contributed strongly to motivation and positive emotional
            experience.

            The project culminated in FoodDecode — a fully conceptualized
            digital platform that makes the world of processed foods
            transparent, understandable, and actionable. FoodDecode demonstrates
            how UX design can empower healthier everyday decisions by combining
            clarity, accessibility, and emotional engagement.
